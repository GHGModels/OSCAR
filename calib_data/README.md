## Calibration data

For now, the data required to calibrate OSCAR on-the-fly is not made available on GitHub because of the significant size of the files. The files used to calibrate newer versions of OSCAR (v3 onward) can be provided upon request, however.

The following files can be requested:
* `land_TRENDYv7.nc`, used to calibrate the preindustrial land carbon-cycle.
